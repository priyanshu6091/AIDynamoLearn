In a circuit switching network, let's break it down:\n- Definition:\n    - Circuit switching is a method used in telecommunications networks where two nodes (such as phones or\n \ncomputers) establish a dedicated communications channel (referred to as a \"circuit\") through the network\n \nbefore they can communicate.\n    - Once established, this circuit guarantees the full bandwidth of the channel and remains connected for\n \nthe entire duration of the communication session .\n- How It Works:\n    - When two devices want to communicate, they set up a dedicated path (circuit) between them.\n    - This path remains open throughout the conversation, ensuring a constant data rate.\n    - Data can be transmitted without any delays once the circuit is established.\n    - Think of it like an old-school telephone call: when you pick up the phone, a circuit is created, and you\n \ncan talk without interruptions until you hang up.","metadata":{"source":"pdfs\\a2.pdf","pdf":{"version":"1.10.100","info":{"PDFFormatVersion":"1.6","IsAcroFormPresent":false,"IsXFAPresent":false,"Title":"file:///F/Project/SGP3/Answer.txt","Creator":"Adobe Acrobat 20.0","Producer":"Acrobat Web Capture 15.0","CreationDate":"D:20240306151953+05'30'","ModDate":"D:20240306152026+05'30'"},"metadata":{"_metadata":{"xmp:modifydate":"2024-03-06T15:20:26+05:30","xmp:createdate":"2024-03-06T15:19:53+05:30","xmp:metadatadate":"2024-03-06T15:20:26+05:30","xmp:creatortool":"Adobe Acrobat 20.0","dc:format":"application/pdf","dc:title":"file:///F/Project/SGP3/Answer.txt","xmpmm:documentid":"uuid:a86b6160-edfd-457f-977a-9d56d82d3a4f","xmpmm:instanceid":"uuid:c8912c73-2dcf-46fd-beb6-14e5be190046","pdf:producer":"Acrobat Web Capture 15.0"}},"totalPages":1},"loc":{"pageNumber":1,"lines":{"from":1,"to":20}}}}],["b3074ace-c570-41a2-9f69-5d55ff89c094",{"pageContent":"- Think of it like an old-school telephone call: when you pick up the phone, a circuit is created, and you\n \ncan talk without interruptions until you hang up.\n- Advantages:\n    - Guaranteed Data Rate: The dedicated circuit ensures a consistent data rate.\n    - Predictable Delay: Bit delay remains constant during the connection.\n    - Stable Connection: Once established, the circuit remains connected until termination.\n- Drawbacks:\n    - Inefficient Resource Use: Resources (such as bandwidth and switch ports) are reserved along the entire\n \npath, even during periods of low or no communication.\n    - Limited Scalability: Not suitable for large-scale networks due to the need for dedicated paths between\n \nevery pair of nodes.\n    - Vulnerability to Failures: Dedicated paths can make the network susceptible to cable cuts or switch\n \nfailures.\n    - Delay and Latency: Establishing the circuit introduces delay.\n    - High Cost: Resource reservation can be expensive.","metadata":{"source":"pdfs\\a2.pdf","pdf":{"version":"1.10.100","info":{"PDFFormatVersion":"1.6","IsAcroFormPresent":false,"IsXFAPresent":false,"Title":"file:///F/Project/SGP3/Answer.txt","Creator":"Adobe Acrobat 20.0","Producer":"Acrobat Web Capture 15.0","CreationDate":"D:20240306151953+05'30'","ModDate":"D:20240306152026+05'30'"},"metadata":{"_metadata":{"xmp:modifydate":"2024-03-06T15:20:26+05:30","xmp:createdate":"2024-03-06T15:19:53+05:30","xmp:metadatadate":"2024-03-06T15:20:26+05:30","xmp:creatortool":"Adobe Acrobat 20.0","dc:format":"application/pdf","dc:title":"file:///F/Project/SGP3/Answer.txt","xmpmm:documentid":"uuid:a86b6160-edfd-457f-977a-9d56d82d3a4f","xmpmm:instanceid":"uuid:c8912c73-2dcf-46fd-beb6-14e5be190046","pdf:producer":"Acrobat Web Capture 15.0"}},"totalPages":1},"loc":{"pageNumber":1,"lines":{"from":20,"to":38}}}}],["583600d7-cc52-427c-9703-5e790032d9c7",{"pageContent":"failures.\n    - Delay and Latency: Establishing the circuit introduces delay.\n    - High Cost: Resource reservation can be expensive.\n    - Lack of Flexibility: Only allows one type of communication at a time (e.g., voice or data).\nIn summary, circuit switching provides a stable, predictable connection but comes with trade-offs in terms of\n \nresource usage and scalability.
